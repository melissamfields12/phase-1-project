Random Facts about Numbers 1-50

Users can use this application to view random facts about numbers 1-50. 

When users first arrive to this web application, a random fact about a random number from 1 to 50 will automatically appear on the screen. Users can hover 
over any part of the random fact to briefly highlight the fact's font in red. 

To view more facts about random numbers, users can click next and a new random
fact about a different random number from 1 to 50 will be automatically generated.

Users can also search for a random fact by typing any number from 1 to 50 into the search bar and then clicking search. An alert will appear if the number the user searched for is not a number ranging from 1 to 50.
